# SDCND06_Control_and_Trajectory_Tracking

 Project 6 of Udacity's "Self-Driving Car Engineer" Nanodegree Program about control and trajectory tracking for automomous vehicles. This repository contains the full code required to run the simulation on Udacity's student environment. It is derived from Udacity's starter code page, which you can find in this [repository](https://github.com/udacity/nd013-c6-control-starter.git). 

## Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Control for Vehicle Trajectory Tracking

This project focuses on setting up PID controllers to perform vehicle trajectory tracking in a 3D simulation environment using [Carla](https://carla.org/). The goal is to implement and parameterize two independent, decoupled PID controllers for longitudinal and lateral motion control of an ego vehicle, and finally test the implementation in a given simulation scenario, s. fig. 1. Given a 2D trajectory as an array of target locations and desired target velocities for each location, which is generated by a behavior and trajectory planner, the two PID controllers are supposed to track the desired target velocities along the given trajectory (longitudinal controller) and the lateral deviation of the vehicle position from the desired trajectory (lateral controller) as good as possible. The PID controller settings are then tested a pre-set 3D simulation scenario.

* `pip3 install matplotlib`

### Step 1: Implementat a PID controller class
The definition and implementation of a generic `PID` controller class can be found in the directory `/project/pid_controller` in the ffollowing files:
* `pid_controller.h`
* `pid_controller.cpp`

The simulation is set up and controlled using the python API interface to CARLA, which implemented in `simulatorAPI.py` in the `/project` directory. The communication between the main control cycle and CARAL's simulation API is realized using uWebSockets connection.

### Step 2: Implement a PID controller for longitudinal motion control (throttle control)
In the `main.cpp` file the iterative behavior and trajectory planning and vehicle motion control cycle is implemented for both longitudinal and lateral motion tracking. The dynamic hehavior of a vehicle in longitudinal direction can be roughly approximated by a linear [PT1 element](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/PT1-Glied) where the inertia of the vehicle is responsible for the main time constant of the PT1 element. A PID controller is a suitable choise for such system. Therefore, an instance of the `PID`class is set up in `main.cpp` for velocity control, or throttle control, respectively. It tries to minimize the velocity control error, which is the difference between the desired velocity (velocity setpoint) and the actual velocity.

`velocity_error = velocity_setpoint - velocity`

The output of the PID throttle controller is bound to the output limits [-1, 1] and saturates if the output of an unlimited PID controller would exceed these limits. Anti-windup is used to prevent the PID integrator from further integrating the control error when output limits are reached. This reduces delays and prevents from unnecessary oscillations when the control ouptut falls back into the allowed saturation limits. Thanks to anti-windup, the integral part of the PID controller will be able to react on further changes at once.

Behind the throttle controller, the control output signal is then split into a throttle actuation signal using the positive part of the control output > 0 and a brake output signal using the negative part of the control output <= 0. These are then fed to the throttle actuator and the brake actuator, respectively.

### Step 3: PID controller for lateral motion control (steer control)
The kinematic behavior of a typical 4-wheeled vehicle can be approximated by a so-called [bicycle model (Ackermann model)](https://thomasfermi.github.io/Algorithms-for-Automated-Driving/Control/BicycleModel.html), which is non-linear and is prone to strong oscillations if control actuation is not applied appropriately. Of course, the dynamic lateral vehicle control behavior is also non-linear, and what is more, depends on the speed, too, as higher speed reduces the time constants. For such systems a PID controller with constant control parameters is not a good choice at all. Other control algorithms like a [Stanley Control](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265641608_Longitudinal_and_lateral_control_for_autonomous_ground_vehicles) or a [Model-Predictive Control (MPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_predictive_control) considering the non-linear, velocity-dependent dynamic behavior using the [inner-model-principle](https://www.control.utoronto.ca/~wonham/W.M.Wonham_IMP_20180617.pdf) are better suited to tackle this task. In my personal opinion, I really like the [Stanley Controller](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265641608_Longitudinal_and_lateral_control_for_autonomous_ground_vehicles) as it is very simple, considers both cross-track and yaw error can adapt easily to different speed levels. It is also capable to find back to track even for very large deviations. There even exists solutions for a [Predictive Stanley Controller](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1729881420974852). However, Stanley control requires the front axle center position to be known. Udacity's starter code only provides the vehicle's center position, and after different tries and research on internet I couldn't figure out a straight forward way how to get the correct front axle position for the ego vehicle from CARLA. Therefore and because Udacity explicitly requests it, a PID control is used here as a steer controller. At least, one can see from the experiments tuning the lateral PID controller parameters what problems can arise when using this solution. For example, lateral motion easily becomes instable especially at higher speeds or larger cross-track errors such that the ego car crashes into obstacles or leaves the road. Or we will see strong osciallations with large deviations from the desired track. Only with a lot of tests we can find some half-ways acceptable control parameters that work in a more or less satisfactory way.

Besides the choise of the control algorithm we also have to choose which control variable(s) to use. Choosing a suitable control variable for lateral motion control is not as straight forward as for velocity control. For 2D kinematics we should consider both cross-track error and yaw error, meaning that the center of the ego vehicle (or one of its axcle center positions) should follow the desired trajectory with only small lateral deviations and that the orientation of the ego vehicle should map to the tangent of desired trajectory at the same time. In order to simplify the problem I am using only one control variable here - not a mixture. For me it turned out that controlling the cross-track error works better than controlling the pure yaw error (even when using a further away lookahead waypoint as a target point to pursue). In the latter case I found it harder to find parameters that would make the controller find back to track if larger cross-track errors occur.

The cross-track error (meaning the lateral deviations) can be calculated in different ways. In this simulation I am using the cross-track error with respect to the ego vehicle's center position as it is already given. Transforming the desired trajectory into the ego vehicle's moving coordinate system simplifies the problem to obtain the cross-track error with the correct sign. One just has to read the y-coordinate of the closest waypoint on the desired trajectory in the relative ego vehicle coordinate system, for example.

To bring in some more stability it is recommendable not to pursue the closest waypoint on the desired trajectory to the current ego vehicle center position, but rather to follow some lookahead target point on the desired trajectory - similar to [pure pursuit control](https://thomasfermi.github.io/Algorithms-for-Automated-Driving/Control/PurePursuit.html).

Similarly to the PID throttle controller, the output of the PID steer controller is bound to the output limits [-1.2, 1.2]. It aturates if the control output of an unlimited PID controller would exceed these limits. Anti-windup is used to prevent the PID integrator from further integrating the error when output limits are reached. This reduces delays when the control ouptut falls back into the allowed saturation limits, such that the integral part of the PID controller is at once able to react on further changes.

### Step 4: Tune the PID control parameters and evaluate the results

#### Working principle of the PID controller
The [Proportional-Integral-Differential (PID) controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) is the most-widely used standard controller in industry. It does not contain any inner model, but uses three gains, namely:
* a proportional gain Kp to proportionally amplify the control error (= control set value - actual control value)
* an integral gain Ki to amplify the integral of the control error (which also requires us to define an initial value for the integral error - usually we set it to zero)
* and a differential gain Kd to amplify the time derivative of the control error
These three amplified control error components are added to the resulting output of the controller. The resulting control output signal should be furthermore limited by a saturation element bounding the output signal to the minimum and maxiumum possible output limit of the actuator that follows the controller (a real actuator will never produce an infinite magnitude). When we apply a saturation element to limit the control output we also need to prevent the PID controller from [integral windup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_windup). This happens when the control output overshoots its limits over a longer period of time. In this case a large integral error will be accumulated, which needs to be reduced before the I part of the controller can react normally again. This can lead to a longer lag time combined with oscillations. Therefore, we also need to implement some anti-windup method that stops the integrator stops from continuing integration when an output limit is reached.

#### Tuning the PID control parameters
Tuning the PID controller parameters usually works as follows
1. Initially we set the inital integral value to a suitable value (e.g. zero as we start from stillstand without errors).
2. Set all controller gains to zero.
3. Increase the proportional gain Kp in steps until the system gets instable, then turn it back leaving some stability margin. The resulting setup will leave some remaining offset between the desired and the actual conrol variable.
4. Increase the differential gain Kd to reduce controller reaction time or to dampen overshots to some extend.
5. Increase the integral gain Ki gradually until the control error starts decreasing ... ideally converging to zero over time.

#### Issues with independent, decoupled longitudinal and lateral motion contoller
Tracking a 2D trajectory with independent longitudinal and lateral controllers is not an ideal solution as longitudinal and lateral motion are automatically coupled by the given trajectory shape. It actually only works properly when both motion controllers are perfectly tuned to the planned test trajectories and are adjusted to one another, too. If one or both of them do not follow the desired trajectory component well enough problems will automatically occur, such that the other control behavior is affected, too. For instance, if the vehicle velocity control is too slow / too quick and lacks behind / overshoots the planned velocity trajectory, the lateral controller will likely loose loose track or becomes instable as it will see an increasing cross-track error. At some point the gap will be too large to find back to track. It becomes even worse if the behavior planner does not wait for motion control either. Unfortunately, this is the case in our simulation. Ideally, we should couple longitudinal and lateral trajectory tracking considering to the natural behavior of our ego vehicle. This can be achieved by Model Predictive Control (MPC). Being able to incorporate the coupled non-linear behavior of our vehicle is probably one of the greatest advantages of MPC over simple PID control. This leaves a lot of room for improvements.

#### Test results with different PID control parameters
Table 1a and 1b list the parameter combinations I have used for testing longitudinal (throttle) and lateral (steer) motion control in the given simulation scenario. In test sequence a I use the yaw error for lateral control. In test sequence b I use the cross-track error (cte) with respect to the ego vehicle center point. The control parameters have been set following roughly above guidlines for adjusting PID control parameters but also involving some intuitive adaptions to reduce the number of tries. Table 2a and 2b show the results, which have been obtained by applying the two decoupled PID controllers for longitudinal (throttle) and lateral (steer) motion control. Knowing that the PID controller design is not really ideal for this setup, my goal for parameter tuning was only to do some kind of "decent" results that would not look too bad. As parameter tuning using CARLA is really tedious I have stopped this procedure at a certain point of time although there might be some more room for improvements.

*Table 1b: Results for PID steer and throttle control with parameters from table 1b using cross-track error for lateral control*

The experiments with PID controllers show that lateral control using cross-track error better than lateral control using only the yaw error. In both cases we need some lookahead waypoint on the desired trajectory to pursue, which brings in more stability compared to the case when tracking the closest waypoint. This is due to the nonlinear kinematic behavior which is prone to oscillations in lateral direction. The best results were achieved with test set number 7 from table 1b.

#### Ways to automatically optimize PID control parameters
As our lateral vehicle dynamics are non-linear and velocity dependent, we should actually consider to optimize control parameters over a larger desired speed range. We should define a test trajectory (or multiple test trajectories) to represent the whole target range of longitudinal and lateral control actions (e.g. driving curves at differnent speeds, with different curve radii). The ego vehicle should completely drive this test trajectory (these test trajectories) for all tested parameter constellations. The control errors over the whole test trajectory should be considered in a cost function, e.g. using the cumulative squared control error. Instable conditions need to be filtered out as the cannot be evaluated correctly, e.g. if the vehicle crashes after short time due to instability of the motion controller such that the error function cannot be evaluated completely.

Furthermore, it is not a good idea to tune parameters on a narrow track with obstacles as our controlled ego vehicle behavior can always become instable when changing parameters. We should do the testing - at least the initial testing - on an empty track without any obstacles. Then chances to find back to track for situations with local instability might still be given.

A straight forward but maybe rather inefficient solution to optimize PID control parameters would be to raster pre-defined parameter ranges in a combinatorial sense using a brute-force approach. Still simple but more efficient than brute force approaches are "hill-climber" algorithms like the "twiddle" algorithm that was presented in the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer course.

In any case, I would start testing control algorithms and parameter optimization not using CARLA simulator, but rather with a simplified 2D dynamic bicycle model simulation of my ego vehicle to do a pre-optimization with far less computational overhead. In a second step it makes sense to move over to a more detailed simulation, e.g. using CARLA with pre-optimized control parameters and a suitable pre-tested control algorithm design to do the fine tuning.

#### Final comments and remarks
During control parameter tuning it turned out that the behavior and trajectory planner in this simulation does not wait for the motion controller. It continues planning along an assumed path, which the ego vehicle motion control does not track any more if it looses its track or crashes into an obstacle, for example. This is not an ideal design - especially not for the experiments in this project. As motion control can always get stuck or loose track, the behavior planner should not "run away" and proceed with its trajectory planning, but wait for the ego vehicle and plan a new trajectory starting always at the actual vehicle location. Here would be some potential for further improvements of this simulation setup.
